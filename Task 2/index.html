                    <p> Yoga From The Heart
                        Our journey to advocate Yoga in Singapore started in 2008, with the idea of practicing and
                        teaching “Yoga From The Heart”. This axiom guides all our teachers and staff who are passionate
                        and sincere in bringing authentic Yoga to you. We also believe in caring for our members’
                        Quality of Life, and not just their Yoga Practice. Which is why our teachers and staff know most
                        of our members by name, creating a bond and a 2nd home for their practice.

                        To us, Yoga is not just a trend, but an essential part of life, which is why we developed our
                        very own take of the 4 Pillars so that anyone can Yoga at Real Yoga.</p>
